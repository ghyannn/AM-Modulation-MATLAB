# AM-Modulation-MATLAB

This project contains a MATLAB simulation of Amplitude Modulation (AM) using the Double Sideband Full Carrier (DSBFC) technique. It includes both modulation and demodulation processes.



##  Theory

In amplitude modulation (DSBFC), the carrier signal is varied according to the message signal. The standard equation for an AM signal is:
s(t) = [Ac + Am * cos(2πfmt)] * cos(2πfct)


Where:
- `Ac` is the amplitude of the carrier signal  
- `Am` is the amplitude of the message signal  
- `fc` is the carrier frequency  
- `fm` is the message frequency  

---

##  Modulation Index

The modulation index `μ` is a measure of how much the carrier amplitude is varied by the message signal. It is given by:

μ = Am / Ac


Ideally, μ should be ≤ 1 to avoid overmodulation.



##  Project Contents

- `am_modulation.m` — MATLAB code that performs AM modulation and demodulation
- `output_plot.png` — A sample plot showing the waveform of the modulated and demodulated signals



##  Sample Output

Below is a plot showing the waveform generated by the MATLAB simulation:

##  Notes

- Ensure MATLAB is installed before running the script.
- You can change the values of `Ac`, `Am`, `fc`, and `fm` in the script to observe different modulation effects.
